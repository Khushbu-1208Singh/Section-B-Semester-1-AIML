# Library Inventory Manager – Python OOP Project

This project is a simple Library Inventory Manager built using Python and OOP.  
It allows users to add books, issue/return them, search the catalog, and store everything in a JSON file.

## Features
- Book class with attributes and methods  
- Add, search, issue, and return books  
- JSON file storage for the catalog  
- Exception handling + logging for safety  
- Clean folder structure with modules  
- Menu-based CLI for easy use  

## What I Learned
- OOP concepts (classes, objects, methods)  
- JSON file handling  
- Error handling and logging  
- Creating a modular project  
- Building a menu-driven CLI  

## Project Goal
To understand OOP design and build a small, functional library management system using Python.
