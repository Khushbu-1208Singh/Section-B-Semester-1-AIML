## GradeBook Analyzer – Python CLI

This project is a simple GradeBook Analyzer made using Python. It helps take student marks (manual or from a CSV file), calculate important statistics, assign grades, and show everything in a clean table. The tool makes the whole grading process faster and easier.

# Features

• Calculates average, median, highest, and lowest marks

• Assigns grades (A–F) based on score ranges

• Shows pass and fail students using list comprehension

• Prints a clean, formatted results table

• Menu-driven CLI for repeated analysis

# What I Learned

• Reading data from input and CSV

• Using dictionaries and functions

• Performing statistical calculations

• If–elif logic for grading

• List comprehensions

• Formatting output with f-strings

• Writing a simple menu loop

Project Goal -

To analyze student marks automatically and practice Python concepts like functions, loops, conditions, and data handling.
