## Weather Data Visualiser

Overview - 
This project is a simple weather data analysis tool created using Python. The goal was to load real-world weather data, clean it, analyze key features, and create visualizations that show useful weather patterns such as temperature trends, rainfall distribution, and humidity relationships.

Dataset - 
• The dataset used for this project includes:
• Date
• Temperature at 3pm (Temp3pm)
• Humidity at 3pm (Humidity3pm)
• Rainfall
• Other weather-related columns
• For analysis, the main columns used were Date, Temperature, Rainfall, and Humidity.

Features-
• The project performs the following tasks:
• Loads and cleans weather data
• Converts dates to proper format
• Handles missing values
• Calculates basic statistics (mean, min, max, standard deviation)
• Groups data by month for deeper insights
• Creates visualizations:
   • Daily temperature line chart
   • Monthly rainfall bar chart
   • Temperature vs humidity scatter plot
All output files (plots and cleaned CSV) are saved automatically.

Technologies Used-
• Python
• Pandas
• NumPy
• Matplotlib

Summary-
This project helped me understand how to work with real datasets, clean them, analyze them, and visualize patterns. It also improved my skills in Python libraries commonly used for data science.
